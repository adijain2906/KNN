# KNN
Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbours from scratch

This algorithm has been made from scratch and does a pretty good work of predicting the classes.

This includes cross validaiton, the range of which can be changed. 
The data on which it has been trained is also attached. 

This can work on any data having classes defined in this format - The last element of each row is the class, and the rest are the feature vector.
The Convert-to-2d function was made to convert the 4 features into two features.
